The picture shows the house where I mainly grew up. Why do I say "mainly"? I moved into the house in 4th grade, because before that both my grandmother and my grandfather lived, but my grandfather was no more and my grandmother's house was too big, even with the workers who helped. Before that we lived in an apartment, which I now own with my brother. The house was built in the pre-war period as a summer house, because there is a large area (2ha) around it, where greenhouses and a poultry farm were built. The house was not really suitable for winter life, so when my grandfather returned from the army, he built the second floor and made it suitable for winter as well. The houses is just in reach with the city, so I had to walk away from school or after sports or after music school, but when I approached home, there was always an aura that was not found anywhere else. The dog with the cat were always waiting for me, they were sitting in their post every time. I lived on the first floor and in a room I live was from the beginning of the house, where you can feel the houses history and the power of ancestors can be felt even after the renovation.</p>      <p class="w3-large">In the picture on the apple tree is the main house owner - a kitten named Greta.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
