The 2 main elements of the music school were a group of friends and a trumpet teacher, from whom I learned a lot. It was 6 really adventurous and pleasant years, which were played by the music school and the orchestras I went to. I believe that the ability to learn an instrument is very helpful for further perception and intelligence of life. I graduated from Limbaži Music School, where I learned to play the trumpet. During this time I also went to 2 orchestras. In one orchestra for 2 years, during which I traveled more in Latvia and was at a concert in Russia, which is the only time I was there. I played in the second orchestra for 3 or 4 years. During this time I made friends and spent quite crazy doing nonsense and participating in various adventures as well as concerts. From the Song Festival to the crazy journey in Croatia, Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe. At the moment I resume playing in the LU wind orchestra, but due to the covid pandemic it stopped and there are other plans for the next semester, but it is definitely good to play and I hope to be able to play the trumpet again not only for inspiration, but regularly.</p>	  </div>  </div></body></html>
