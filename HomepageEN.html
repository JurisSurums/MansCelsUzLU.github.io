Mostly when I was younger, I played video games ... At first, my father was not happy, because there were times when downloading games from the web, I got a virus and my father could not play card games, which was the reason he bought a computer. I remember how friends came and we played games in pairs or even added a controller to play in 3 togheter. In time, the games were played and I started to learn the elements of the web, the basics of programming. It also came from web games, but also simple curiosity. I am the generation that saw the development of computer technology. From my first computer in 2006 to the summer of 2018, I had seen the development and growth of both the computer and the phone today. Although computers are basically everything, the use and popularity of the phone has made me realize that this is the future and the time people spend on phones is only growing. All this together led to a decision that I do not regret yet.</p>      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">On other pages you can see the events that have affected this decision and their illustration.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
