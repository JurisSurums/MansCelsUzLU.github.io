I will start from the beginning of my studies until the day I write this article, devoting one or two sentences to each semester. The first semester was very stormy overall. Although I didn't live in Riga before, I've been there a lot, I still had a great feeling of alienation because of a new city. Initially, the classrooms were full and I could not get used to academic learning, but I passed the first semester. In the second semester I started to get to know more people I knew, but we weren't close yet, because in the second semester you can really see those who will stay and those who will leave for one reason or another. The third semester was the key to everything, because I had to write a project in Software Engineering in a group of 5 people. It was this semester that I got closer to 4 more classmates and studied together successfully. In the 4th semester, when covid-19 began to spread and everyone was studying from home, we talked and kept in touch in the evenings, as well as learning the most difficult math courses together in the evenings. It was quite easy in the fifth semester, because I worked harder and in my free time I did a qualification work, which I successfully defended. With the graduation hopefully in the summer and I am very satisfied with the current studies and I hope for further success!</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
