This was the time when personality development began. The first friends, the first teachers / educators were met in the kindergarten and the first bad works were done. I believe that made me the person I am today. Until recently, I looked at the heartfelt drawings we drew for each other on birthdays or name days. One might ask, "Why such a gloomy picture with a kindergarten? Why wasn't it embellished with bright memories of childhood?" The image above has its own story. It demonstrates not only the confusion and fear of learning, but also the event that is most vividly remembered. It was Friday and my brother and I were the last to stay in kindergarten. There was a red moon and no one came. It turned out that the parents had left and the grandmother who had to pick us up thought that we would stay in kindergarten overnight. Luckily we lived across the street, so I knew the way and successfully met the house. This story symbolizes the independence and confidence I hold already then, and will hopefully not disappear in the future.</p>    </div>  </div>  </div></body></html>
