There was always our own children's company, we tried to spend time directly without phones or computers. Summers were usually quite the same events, but never identical. There is a sea near the summer house and then with the neighbors and cousins ​​who lived nearby, we played hide and seek together, swam and played various role-playing games. In my opinion, almost perfect childhood for all of us. There was always something to do, we usually figured out the game and adjusted the rules of the game. It also created a variety of new games. At the moment, it is not possible to spend so many summers there with work and study, and it is no longer so, because in childhood all these games seemed to have a different meaning. Everyone has a good place, which is remembered in difficult times or as the English say "Happy place" and for me this place is home in Tuja, under the pine tree looking over the Baltic Sea horizon. However, I look to the future with hope and although summer will no longer be as it was, the main thing is to look forward with hope and optimism! </p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
